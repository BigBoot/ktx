## Issues

- Before submitting a bug-related issue, make sure that **its source is not the LibGDX itself**.
- It is fine to create issues with simple questions and documentation improvement requests. In fact, issues are among
the fastest way to contact the developers.

## Pull requests

- Use IntelliJ Kotlin code formatter included in the root directory.
- Make sure to include unit tests of your code. Yes, `JUnit` was probably not the best choice for a testing framework
of a Kotlin-based project, so if you want to include your favorite Kotlin alternative, we just might be fine with it.
- If your pull request is not a simple bug fix, make sure to link it to an existing issue (or create an issue with your
proposal first).
